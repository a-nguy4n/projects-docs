                    <h3> About: Vision Statement </h3>
                    <p> UC San Diego students are constantly hit with flyers, social media blasts, and endless
                    invites on Library Walk - it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. That’s where our app, “SoCalSocial”,
                    comes in. “SoCalSocial” aims to centralize and filter information on a more personalized 
                    basis, showing students events that only matter to them. This reduces the stress from 
                    information overload, so students can focus on what really matters without the clutter.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> I want a centralized place where I can effortlessly track the events related
                                to organizations in UC San Diego and know more about them. </li>
                            <li> I want a place where I can discover new organizations and their events as
                                well as events hosted by organizations I follow. </li>

                    <p> Students - A student who attends some events, and is a member of some organizations. </p>

                            and discover events hosted by organizations I follow. </li> </ul>

                    <ul> <li> As an organization, I would like to be able to list events in a centralized 
                            location to advertise events with a much further reach. </li> </ul>
                    <p> Individuals within organizations, such as club officers and board members. </p>
                    <ul> <li> I would like to view and manage the events I am involved in. </li> </ul>

                    <ul>

                    <h4> Risk that may lead to the failure of the product </h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Customers might have stickiness to other pre-existing apps and do not want to add the
                                 new platform to their advertising. </li>

                            <li> Authentication system is complicated and can be easily messed up.</li>

                            <li> Bad design and coding leading to convolution and then it becomes hard to add new 
                                features or understand what is going on. </li>

                            <li> The calendar page might be tricky to implement especially with respect to being 
                                responsive to day-to-day changes. </li>

                            <li> Maintaining the ability to host the website on everyone’s devices. For example, all persons 
                                would need to be able to successfully run the website and database at minimum. </li>
                        </ol>

                     <h4> Plan to resolve the most serious risks </h4>
                        <ol> 
                            <li> Connect with student networks and the access to multiple popular orgs for 
                                advertising the app. </li>

                            <li> Backup if authentication does not work: Only club accounts can edit and post events. 
                                Org leads can switch to the club account to manage events. </li>

                            <li> Maintain simplicity by sticking to few yet essential features; make use of peer and 
                                user feedback to help improve design and code. </li>

                            <li> Provide an ordered list of all related events without any calendar. </li>

                            <li> Initial runs would involve capping the number of users and clubs using the website 
                                until proper infrastructure is obtained. Other ways include capping the number of events 
                                one can be interested in, number of friends per user and number of events a club can publish 
                                on a given timeframe. </li>

                    <h3> Technology Plan</h3>
                    <p> Along with using React/TypeScript/HTML/CSS, we will certainly need a database to store
                        information about users, clubs, events, and more across a few tables. A few of our group
                        members already have experience with SQL and relational databases, so it shouldn’t be
                        overwhelming to add this to our plate. We will be sure to assign people to tasks according to
                        their strengths and experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>The other service that we will need is a backend, for which we were thinking of using the
                        flask module for python. Every member of our group has experience with python and some
                        even have experience with flask, meaning there shouldn’t be a large amount of research
                        required on this task. We believe our app will be more front-end-heavy in terms of development
                        effort, but we will designate at least one member of the team to focus more on the backend.
